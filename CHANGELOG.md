# Changelog

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- `AutoClaw: Doctor (Health Check)` command (`autoclaw.doctor`) — surfaces a
  single comprehensive read-only health report covering workspace state,
  KDream `state.json`, MEMORY.md follow-up counts and required sections,
  log-file presence, adapter drift vs `skills/`, per-host adapter installation
  (claude-code, kilocode, cline, cursor, antigravity, windsurf, kiro,
  continue), ZippyMesh LLM Router reachability, and skill-source sanity. The
  report is rendered into a dedicated `AutoClaw Doctor` OutputChannel so it
  can be copy-pasted or diffed.
- MAteam and `/kdream work` now explicitly dispatch via `Agent` tool on Claude Code and degrade to in-session execution elsewhere, instead of leaving the choice ambiguous.
- Export Health Snapshot — dashboard button + `autoclaw.exportSnapshot` command save the doctor report plus state/logs/follow-ups to a single Markdown file.
- AutoBuild scheduler now actually executes cron-scheduled workflows from the extension host. A 30-second tick (configurable via `autoclaw.autobuild.tickIntervalSeconds`, off when `autoclaw.autobuild.enabled` is false) reads `.autoclaw/autobuild/workflows/*.yaml`, fires due workflows, streams stdout/stderr to `.autoclaw/autobuild/runs/<name>-<ISO>.log` (truncated at 1 MB), honours per-step `timeout`, and updates `registry.json`. New commands `AutoClaw: AutoBuild — Run Workflow Now` and `AutoClaw: AutoBuild — Tail Most Recent Run Log`; doctor gained an `## AutoBuild` section listing scheduled workflows and last-run status.

### Fixed
- Removed `K:/Projects/zippymesh-router` and `S:/Projects/zippymesh-router` developer drive paths from the ZippyMesh MCP setup wizard. Candidate search is now workspace-relative first, then `~/zippymesh-router`, then user-supplied paths from the new `autoclaw.kdream.zippymeshSearchPaths` setting.
- `getCodeChurnMetrics` aggregates lines added/deleted across the last 30 days of commits instead of just the most recent diff (`HEAD~1..HEAD`).
- `churnRate` (lines per day) and `avgCommitSize` (lines per commit) now use distinct formulas instead of returning the same value.
- `adapterCoverage` no longer divides by zero when the adapter health array is empty.
- ZippyMesh LLM Router health check has a 60-second cache with ±5 second jitter; "healthy" requires either a ZippyMesh-identifying response header or a JSON body that names ZippyMesh, not just a 200 OK on the configured port.
- All blocking `execSync` git calls in the dashboard refresh path were replaced with awaited `execFile` so the extension host stops stalling on large repositories.
- `mergeKiloModes` now upgrades existing `.kilocodemodes` files in place when the AutoClaw block is delimited by a marker comment, instead of leaving stale modes for users upgrading from older AutoClaw releases.

### Distribution
- VSIX is now runtime-only: 45 files / ~150 KB. `out/test/`, `out/scripts/`, source maps, and dev-only workspace artifacts (`.autoclaw/`, `.kilocodemodes`, `.voidspec/`, `.kilo/`) are excluded from the published package.
- Published to the VS Code Marketplace as `ZippyTechnologiesLLC.autoclaw v1.2.5` (2026-04-30T12:40:23Z).
- Published to Open VSX as `ZippyTechnologiesLLC.autoclaw v1.2.5` (2026-05-01T05:59:03Z) — VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Theia and other Eclipse-Open-VSX clients can now install AutoClaw.
- Cross-platform publish wrappers `scripts/publish-vsce.js` and `scripts/publish-ovsx.js` load credentials from a local `.env` (template at `.env.example`). New `npm run publish:all` packages and pushes to both registries.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- KDream `start` failed under Kilo Code on Windows because the agent fell back to
  `mkdir -p`, which PowerShell rejects. All skills (kdream, autobuild, mateam) and
  adapter copies (claude-code, kilocode, cline, cursor, antigravity, windsurf, kiro,
  continue) now instruct the agent to create directories and files with the host's
  file/write tool instead of shelling out, and to use forward slashes.
- `/kdream start` is now explicitly idempotent — if `state.json` already shows
  `status=="running"`, the agent skips init and just runs a fresh tick instead of
  re-initialising state.

### Changed
- Each skill gained an "Operating Rules" header that pins output discipline
  (≤3 short confirmation lines, no reasoning narration, no invented style rules)
  to suppress the verbose / repetitive startup transcripts seen under some hosts.
- `start` confirmation now reports concrete counts (uncommitted, TODOs, follow-ups)
  rather than the generic "KDream is running."

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- License updated to Zippy Technologies Source-Available Commercial License v1.3
  (personal/educational use remains free; commercial use requires a paid license)

### Fixed

  via package override (does not affect the published extension — devDeps are not bundled)
- Updated `@vscode/test-cli` to 0.0.12
